# QA_chatbot_llama2
The aim of the task is to gain a quick and well-founded overview of the many possible applications of Llama-2. To this end, a question-answering system based on scientific publications is to be developed. The scientific papers available on [Arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/) on the subject of "Llama" will serve as the primary source of information.

For this purpose, I decided to use a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Langchain on colab.

Further Research:

- better preprocessing of the text: e.g. the \n- in the QA are disturbing the readibility
- Conversational Retrieval Chain
